# password_generator
This CLI program will ask the user 3 questions and uses those answers to generator a password.

1.  How many letters would you like in your password?

2.  How many numbers would you like in your password?

3. How many symbols would you like in your password?

Remember:  Complex passwords are said to be 8-16 characters long with upper and lowercase as well as numbers and symbols.  Check out this site https://www.security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/Links to an external site.

This assignment offers an additional challenge.  You can generate a password that will select a sequence of letters, then numbers, then symbols.  For example:  TuXa2795!(*%     <--- notice all the letters are grouped together, and the same for the numbers as well as the symbols

or 

You can challenge yourself and see if you can randomize the whole thing.  For example:  T8r)9a@!B3l   <----notice the randomization and wonder of it all?
